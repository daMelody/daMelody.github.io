This is part of a multi-part series of posts focusing on [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/), by Cathy O'Neil.

## On the Intro

In these first two sections of the book, Cathy O'Neil lays down the justification for why such a topic requires a book in the first place and why she is the one to write it. O'Neil gave up a tenure-track position in the Barnard/Columbia Math Department to pursue an opportunity as a data engineer in the business world. She was immediately struck by the poorly-designed algorithms which haunt us through our daily lives.

Her introduction sets us in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 housing collapse where she observes that "mathematics ... was not only deeply entangled in the world's problems but also fueling many of them." This perspective has been the motivation for most of her work since. Her journey towards this book started with a blog called [MathBabe](https://mathbabe.org/), where O'Neil attempted to raise awareness within the math world about the use of "sloppy statistics and biased models." As the Occupy Wall Street movement grew in 2011, she realized that many of the critiques shared by the Occupiers missed certain fundamental details of finance -- though, in her words, "you don't need to understand ... a system to know that it has failed." With this, she realized that it wasn't just enough to lobby within the statistical world. Cathy O'Neil had to spread this information to the public. First, this was through a series of meetings with the Alternative Banking Group at Columbia University. Years later, we have this book.

> many of these models encoded human prejudice, misunderstanding, and bias into the software systems that increasingly managed our lives. Like gods, these mathematical models were opaque, their workings invisible to all but the highest priests in their domain... Their verdicts, even when wrong or harmful, were beyond dispute or appeal. And they tended to punish the poor and the oppressed in our society, while making the rich richer.

Cathy O'Neil shares with us a striking story from within then-struggling school system of Washington DC. A data-science approach (called IMPACT) was brought in to help the district evaluate teacher performances and therefore prune and replace the ineffective ones.  The model would have the students take yearly benchmark tests where progress would be measured against the previous year. Of course, this benchmark test could not account for any outside world disturbances that might affect a child's path of learning: family trouble, health issues, etc. O'Neil shares the story of one particular teacher who was, by all rights, unjustly fired due to the findings of this model. In this case, the teacher found a post in a wealthier district -- and so the algorithm ended up uprooting one of the districts better teachers instead.

O'Neil points out that "attempting to score a teacher's effectiveness by analyzing the test results of only twenty-five or thirty students is statistically unsound, even laughable." Advertisement algorithms run by Google and the like have millions of data points from which they can draw guidance. The IMPACT algorithm did not. Still, the district board believed that the algorithm would draw correct conclusions and acted accordingly which draws another piece of criticism: "Instead of searching for the truth, the score comes to embody it."
