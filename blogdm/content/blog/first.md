Most of the theory powering this post -- and my revelation -- I found while reading Adam Grimes' book, [The Art and Science of Technical Analysis](https://adamhgrimes.com/the-art-and-science-the-book/). Go check this out for a boatload of incredibly useful information.

## Who is Wyckoff?

Back in the olden days of stock trading and investing, long before there were people like me who could throw money at markets and watch it rise and fall with little understanding of why it went up or down... there were four horsemen: JP Morgan, Jesse Livermore, Charles Dow, and Bernard Bruch. There was also a guy riding a donkey just a few feet behind them. His name was Richard Wyckoff. This is his story.

## What is Wyckoff?

Richard Wyckoff was a smart dude, and an investor... so unlike many of us, he made so much money in the stock markets he got bored and cashed out. He then decided to share his wisdom with the rest of us plebs.

> Wyckoff created a method for understanding the buying and selling convictions of *very* large traders and institutions through the patterns their activity left on prices.

>**-- Grimes, pp. 41;
> *emphasis* is mine**

He describes these patterns as part of a **Market Cycle** in which there are four parts, or seasons, if you're feeling poetic -- I am :).  They are:
- *Accumulation:* big firms slowly buy up shares while price is low, taking care to buy in small enough amounts over a long enough time period that the price action doesn't immediately reveal this activity
- *Markup:* public becomes aware, interest and buying pressure grows as the individual STONK buyers try to get in on the fun
- *Distribution:* we've reached the end of the road lads and we may not know it, but the big cahunas do
- *Markdown:* the big firms knew the jig was up and got out while the getting was good. Now the market doesn't have the support and starts to drop, sometimes precipitously, and keeps dropping

N.B. The length of these seasons are slow moving, and positively glacial to a daytrader's perspective.

## Where is Wyckoff?

6 feet under somewhere, I'm guessing. I hope...

## Why is Wyckoff?

At the time of writing (August, 2020), I've experienced the disappointment and frustration of being unaware of these seasons and the accompanying market behavior. Exhibit A:

Analysis (Weekly View): *here we see a markdown phase from September 2018 into the beginning of 2019. We then see the accumulation phase between January and May 2019; this is when the markup phase begins in earnest. As we know, COVID19 shook things up in March and caused a sharp economic downturn. So the markup phase may have been cut short, but as of August 2020 the price has mostly recovered.*

Analysis (Daily View): *the highlighted rectangle shows a region that XPO has only gone above once in the past 10 months or so -- and failed to break through on three separate occasions. The last of these being Thursday and Friday of last week (July 28-July 31, 2020).* 

My entrance actually wasn't terrible: 4 days before the rightmost (YUGE) red bar on an upswing following the small downward correction -- $82.93 on 7/27/2020. When I had planned my trade, I was not looking back past March 2020 and I had planned to sell before earnings (didn't do that last part, YIKES!!!). If I had looked back, I swouldn't have gotten fooled by the small upward trend approaching the top of the highlighted rectangle on the Daily chart and thought that it had better odds of continuing than stopping.

I then -- probably was stupid, but we shall see -- bought into the fall at $74.685 a share in a possibly desperate ploy to cost-average down.

## Conclusion

Who knows.... I'll find out next week probably.

I've learned my lesson though: always be aware of the price movement over a larger timeframe than you think is necessary, and don't get fooled by small momentum gains (particularly around points of historical failure and/or leading into earnings reports). I'll never have the fundamental analysis skills or access to data that the big firms do, so I shouldn't compete with them. Holding shares in a moment when a treasure trove of fundamental data gets released... is certainly competing with them.
